# VPN Project Plan

## Overview

Build a custom VPN solution using Rust (for backend networking) and TypeScript (for frontend/admin panel), hosted on an AWS VM. The VPN will allow secure tunneling of client traffic through the server, with authentication and basic management features.

---

## 1. Requirements & Goals

- **Secure tunneling**: Encrypt traffic between client and server
- **Cross-platform clients**: CLI (Rust), optional GUI (TypeScript/Electron)
- **Admin panel**: Web dashboard for user management, stats (TypeScript/Next.js)
- **Authentication**: User accounts, tokens, or certificates
- **Scalability**: Deployable on AWS EC2, with Docker support
- **Logging & monitoring**: Basic traffic stats, error logs

---

## 2. Architecture

- **Server (Rust):**
  - Handles VPN protocol (WireGuard-like or custom)
  - Manages client connections, encryption, routing
  - Exposes REST API for admin panel
- **Client (Rust):**
  - CLI tool for connecting to VPN
  - Handles encryption, tunneling
- **Admin Panel (TypeScript/Next.js):**
  - User management, connection stats
  - Communicates with server REST API
- **Deployment:**
  - Dockerized services
  - Hosted on AWS EC2 (Ubuntu)

---

## 3. Roadmap & Milestones

1. **Research & Design**
   - Study VPN protocols (WireGuard, OpenVPN)
   - Decide on protocol (reuse or custom)
   - Design system architecture
2. **Server MVP (Rust)**
   - TCP/UDP socket handling
   - Basic encryption (Noise, TLS, or custom)
   - Simple user auth (JWT, password)
   - REST API for admin
3. **Client MVP (Rust)**
   - Connect to server, tunnel traffic
   - Auth & config file support
4. **Admin Panel (TypeScript/Next.js)**
   - User CRUD, stats dashboard
   - API integration
5. **Deployment**
   - Dockerize server & panel
   - AWS EC2 setup, security groups
   - SSL certs for web panel
6. **Testing & Security**
   - Penetration testing
   - Audit encryption/auth
   - Logging & monitoring
7. **Documentation & Scaling**
   - Write usage docs
   - Add multi-user support, scaling tips

## 4. Detailed Steps

### A. Research & Design

- Learn Rust async networking (tokio, async-std)
- Study VPN packet formats, encryption
- Decide on protocol (WireGuard is recommended for simplicity)
- Plan REST API endpoints

### B. Server Implementation

- Set up Rust project (Cargo)
- Implement socket server (TCP/UDP)
- Add encryption (Noise protocol crate, or TLS)
- User authentication (JWT or password)
- REST API (actix-web, axum)
- Dockerfile for server

### C. Client Implementation

- Rust CLI app (structopt/clap)
- Connect to server, handle encryption
- Tunnel traffic (TUN/TAP device on Linux)
- Config file support

### D. Admin Panel

- Next.js app (TypeScript)
- User login, dashboard
- API calls to server
- Dockerfile for panel

### E. Deployment

- AWS EC2 setup (Ubuntu)
- Install Docker, deploy containers
- Set up security groups (allow VPN port, HTTPS)
- SSL certs (Let's Encrypt)

### F. Testing & Security

- Test with multiple clients
- Penetration testing (try common attacks)
- Monitor logs, set up alerts

---

## 5. Challenges & Considerations

- **Networking:** Handling TUN/TAP devices, routing traffic
- **Encryption:** Implementing secure protocols, avoiding leaks
- **Authentication:** Preventing unauthorized access
- **Cross-platform:** Windows/Mac/Linux support for client
- **AWS Security:** Proper firewall/security group setup
- **Scaling:** Handling multiple clients, performance
- **Legal:** VPN usage laws in your region

## 6. Resources

- [WireGuard Whitepaper](https://www.wireguard.com/papers/wireguard.pdf)
- [Tokio Rust Docs](https://docs.rs/tokio)
- [AWS EC2 Docs](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/ec2/)
- [Next.js Docs](https://nextjs.org/docs)
- [Noise Protocol](https://noiseprotocol.org/)

---

## 7. Next Steps

1. Research VPN protocols and Rust networking
2. Scaffold Rust server & client projects
3. Design REST API and admin panel UI
4. Start with MVP server/client, test locally
5. Dockerize and deploy to AWS
6. Expand features, improve security

## 8. Final Notes

Building a VPN is a complex, security-critical project. Start simple, iterate, and always prioritize security. Consider using existing protocols (WireGuard) for reliability. Document every step and test thoroughly.
